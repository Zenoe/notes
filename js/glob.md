In the `glob` package, the `globSync` function is a synchronous version of the `glob` function. It allows you to perform file globbing synchronously, without using callbacks or Promises.

The `globSync` function takes a glob pattern as its first argument and returns an array of file paths that match the pattern.

Here's an example usage of `globSync`:

```javascript
const glob = require('glob');

const files = glob.sync('path/to/files/*.txt');
console.log(files);
```

In the code above, `glob.sync` is used to perform synchronous file globbing. The glob pattern `'path/to/files/*.txt'` is passed as the argument to `glob.sync`, and it returns an array of file paths that match the pattern (in this case, all `.txt` files in the `path/to/files` directory).

The `globSync` function can also accept additional options as the second argument, such as `cwd` (current working directory), `ignore` (patterns to exclude), and `nodir` (whether to include directories in the result).

However, it's worth noting that synchronous file operations can potentially block the event loop in Node.js, so it's generally recommended to use the asynchronous version, `glob`, instead, especially in server-side applications where responsiveness is crucial.

If you prefer to work with asynchronous code, you can use the `glob` function instead of `globSync`. The `glob` function takes the same arguments as `globSync` but returns a Promise, allowing you to work with the results using async/await or Promise-based syntax.
