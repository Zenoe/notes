In JavaScript, the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a Promise is resolved or rejected. It can only be used inside an `async` function.

When an `await` expression is encountered, it allows the function to pause and wait for the Promise to settle. This means that the function will not continue executing the next line until the awaited Promise is resolved or rejected.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `await`:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

In the code above, `fetchData()` is an `async` function. Inside this function, the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution until the `fetch` function returns a Promise. The `await` keyword is also used again to pause the execution until the `response.json()` function returns a Promise.

By using `await`, the code appears to be written in a synchronous manner, even though the underlying operations are asynchronous. This makes it easier to work with Promises and handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and sequential way.

It's important to note that `await` can only be used within an `async` function. If you try to use `await` outside of an `async` function, it will result in a syntax error.

Additionally, using `await` automatically unwraps the resolved value of a Promise, so you can directly assign the resolved value to a variable or use it in subsequent operations.

Overall, `await` simplifies working with Promises and asynchronous code by allowing you to write asynchronous operations in a more synchronous and sequential style.
