Certainly! There are several ways to render array data in a table, and the choice often depends on the nature of the data and the user experience you want to provide. Here are some popular methods:

1. **Comma-Separated Values**: A simple and common approach is to join array elements into a single string separated by commas or another delimiter.

    ```jsx
    render: array => array.join(', ')
    ```

2. **List**: Display the array as a vertical list of items within the cell, which can be helpful if the array can contain many items or if items are long strings.

    ```jsx
    render: array => (
      <ul>
        {array.map(item => (
          <li key={item}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )
    ```

3. **Expandable Rows**: If the array data is complex and you want to keep the table view uncluttered, you can use expandable rows. Ant Design's `Table` supports expandable rows out of the box.

    ```jsx
    // In your Table component
    <Table
      columns={columns}
      dataSource={data}
      expandedRowRender={record => (
        <ul>
          {record.tags.map(tag => (
            <li key={tag}>{tag}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    />
    ```

4. **Tags or Chips**: As shown previously, you can use the `Tag` component from Ant Design to render each item as a tag or chip. This is visually appealing and works well for categorization.

5. **Badges**: Similar to tags, but typically used to indicate status or count.

    ```jsx
    render: array => array.map(item => <Badge status="success" text={item} />)
    ```

6. **Custom Popover**: Use a `Popover` component that shows the full list of items on hover or click, which keeps the table cell compact.

    ```jsx
    render: array => (
      <Popover content={<ul>{array.map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>)}</ul>} title="Details">
        <Button>{array.length} items</Button>
      </Popover>
    )
    ```

7. **Scrollable Container**: For very long arrays, you might want to put the content into a fixed-height, scrollable container within the cell.

    ```jsx
    render: array => (
      <div style={{ maxHeight: '100px', overflowY: 'auto' }}>
        {array.map(item => <div key={item}>{item}</div>)}
      </div>
    )
    ```

8. **Collapsible List**: If the list is long, you could initially show a limited number of items and provide a 'Show more' button to reveal the rest.

    ```jsx
    render: array => (
      <>
        {array.slice(0, 2).map(item => <div key={item}>{item}</div>)}
        {array.length > 2 && <Button>Show more...</Button>}
      </>
    )
    ```

9. **JSON String**: If the array data is for developer eyes only, you might even consider displaying it as a JSON string.

    ```jsx
    render: array => <code>{JSON.stringify(array)}</code>
    ```

Each of these methods can be further customized with styling to fit the design of your application. The best approach will depend on the context in which the data is being used and the needs of your users.
