* useRoutes
 when you define routes using `useRoutes` or `<Routes>`, you can have a parent route with a path of `/` and nested child routes. The parent route serves as the base of your application, typically rendering a layout component that contains a `<Outlet>` where child routes are rendered.

Here's an example of how you might define routes using `useRoutes` with a parent route and child routes:

```jsx
import { useRoutes } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  let element = useRoutes([
    {
      path: '/',
      element: <Layout />, // Your layout component with <Outlet />
      children: [
        { index: true, element: <Home /> }, // Rendered at the root path '/'
        { path: 'about', element: <About /> }, // Rendered at '/about'
        { path: 'contact', element: <Contact /> }, // Rendered at '/contact'
      ],
    },
    // Other routes can also be defined here
  ]);

  return element;
}

function Layout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <header>Header content</header>
      <main>
        <Outlet /> {/* Child routes render here */}
      </main>
      <footer>Footer content</footer>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Layout` component is rendered for the path `/`. It includes an `<Outlet>` where the child routes are rendered depending on the URL. The `index` route with `element: <Home />` is what will be rendered at the root path `/` when no other child paths match.

The `children` array defines the nested routes relative to the parent. When you navigate to `/about`, the `<About />` component is rendered inside the `<Outlet>` of the `Layout` component. Similarly, navigating to `/contact` will render the `<Contact />` component inside the `<Outlet>`.

So, in terms of "overlap," the parent route's element provides the structure within which child routes are rendered, and they don't actually "overlap" but rather "compose" the final UI, with the parent route typically defining a shared layout and the child routes defining the content within that layout.

* useRoutes and Routes
useRoutes is used for programmatic route configuration within a component, offering flexibility for dynamic route definitions, while Routes is used for declarative route configuration in the JSX structure of your application, providing a more static and structured approach to defining routes. The choice between useRoutes and Routes depends on your specific routing needs and whether you prefer a programmatic or declarative approach to defining routes in your React application.
const routes = useRoutes({
  path: '/',
  element: <Home />,
  children: [
    { path: 'about', element: <About /> },
    { path: 'contact', element: <Contact /> }
  ]
});

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="about" element={<About />} />
  <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
</Routes>
