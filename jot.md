reading Hessler's book brought peace into my mind.
which is a bit of surprise.
I admire his way of life, and enjony his experiecne of travelling. 
He explored deep into wild areas, and talked with rural mountain's people.
in neural attitudes he wrote down the about to disappear stories that happend on those lands.

there is an old man live in remote rural village in the outside skirt of Beijing. He has no notion of
whom is the top guy in the country. all he could guess is the one in 80s.
to him, things stay unchnaged before or after the liberation in 1949.

Hi live on corn and flour cake. 'you need meat when you were young, but not when you are old', he said.

the depth of life. this is the words came to me while I was reading his book.
