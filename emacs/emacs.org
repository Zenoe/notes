Ensure your Emacs version is at least 27, the dependency package editorconfig (melpa) and jsonrpc (elpa, >= 1.0.14) are both installed.

Install Node.js v18+. (You can specify the path to node executable by setting copilot-node-executable.)

Setup copilot.el as described in the next section.

Install the copilot server by M-x copilot-install-server.

Login to Copilot by M-x copilot-login. You can also check the status by M-x copilot-diagnose (NotAuthorized means you don't have a valid subscription).

(package! copilot
  :recipe (:host github :repo "copilot-emacs/copilot.el" :files ("*.el")))
Configure copilot in ~/.doom.d/config.el:

;; accept completion from copilot and fallback to company
(use-package! copilot
  :hook (prog-mode . copilot-mode)
  :bind (:map copilot-completion-map
              ("<tab>" . 'copilot-accept-completion)
              ("TAB" . 'copilot-accept-completion)
              ("C-TAB" . 'copilot-accept-completion-by-word)
              ("C-<tab>" . 'copilot-accept-completion-by-word)))
Strongly recommend to enable childframe option in company module ((company +childframe)) to prevent overlay conflict.

If pressing tab to complete sometimes doesn't work you might want to bind completion to another key or try:

(after! (evil copilot)
  ;; Define the custom function that either accepts the completion or does the default behavior
  (defun my/copilot-tab-or-default ()
    (interactive)
    (if (and (bound-and-true-p copilot-mode)
             ;; Add any other conditions to check for active copilot suggestions if necessary
             )
        (copilot-accept-completion)
      (evil-insert 1))) ; Default action to insert a tab. Adjust as needed.

  ;; Bind the custom function to <tab> in Evil's insert state
  (evil-define-key 'insert 'global (kbd "<tab>") 'my/copilot-tab-or-default))
If you would love to configure indentation here, this is an example config that may work for you:

(use-package! copilot
  :hook (prog-mode . copilot-mode)
  :bind (:map copilot-completion-map
              ("<tab>" . 'copilot-accept-completion)
              ("TAB" . 'copilot-accept-completion)
              ("C-TAB" . 'copilot-accept-completion-by-word)
              ("C-<tab>" . 'copilot-accept-completion-by-word)
              ("C-n" . 'copilot-next-completion)
              ("C-p" . 'copilot-previous-completion))

  :config
  (add-to-list 'copilot-indentation-alist '(prog-mode . 2))

Looks like ollama-copilot has instructions for setting up neovim using copilot.vim. Seeing as copilot.el is using copilot.vim, seems possible we could use this and set copilot-network-proxy accordingly? Though from a quick glance at the copilot.el code I don't see anything about the strict ssl setting, so setting that might be an issue.

Hoping to experiment with this myself soon, but in case someone beats me to it 🙂

It actually works!
Regarding "strict ssl": have a look at the variable copilot-network-proxy in copilot.el. You should use :rejectUnauthorized :json-false.

* Alignment messed up in emacs  (dired buffer) :font:
I started to find the font current used by emacs, and it was dejavu-sans. which
I then though was not a fixed font.

By luck I download Hack font recommended by some one from internet. and followed
the instructions to install it on the linux host.
Restart emacs X windows, everything was find!

Linux
Download the latest version of Hack.
Extract the files from the archive (.zip).
Copy the font files to either your system font folder (often /usr/share/fonts/) or user font folder (often ~/.local/share/fonts/ or /usr/local/share/fonts).
Copy the font configuration file in config/fontconfig/ to either the system font configuration folder (often /etc/fonts/conf.d/) or the font user folder (often ~/.config/fontconfig/conf.d)
Clear and regenerate your font cache and indexes with the following command:
$ fc-cache -f -v
You can confirm that the fonts are installed with the following command:

$ fc-list | grep "Hack"

* Incrementally replace a given string; multiple replace
put cursor in the beginning of the text
call replace-regexp
type: nn
type: \,(+ 1 \#)

https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/37898/incrementally-replace-a-given-string
Your replacement string can contain arbitrary lisp code.
From the documentation for replace-regexp:

In interactive calls, the replacement text may contain ‘\,’ followed by a Lisp
expression used as part of the replacement text. Inside of that expression, ‘\&’
is a string denoting the whole match, ‘\N’ a partial match, ‘#&’ and ‘#N’ the
respective numeric values from ‘string-to-number’, and ‘#’ itself for
‘replace-count’, the number of replacements occurred so far, starting from zero.

We can use this technique in a number of ways.

Starting at 25
You can modify this by not just adding one, but (in your example) 25:

C-M-% nn \,(+ 25 \#)

Leading zeros
Or we can use format to add leading zeros. This will replace nn with 000, 001, 002, etc. You can combine other lisp code above to start at 001, 025, or whatever you want.

C-M-% nn \,(format "$03d" \#)

......
Yes, you can do that with [query-]replace-regexp in Emacs, by evaluating elisp in your replacement, and utilising the zero-based replacement counter \#. e.g.:
M-x query-regexp-replace RET S1-S2 RET
\,(let ((start (+ 1000 (* 4 \#)))) (format "%d-%d" start (+ start 3))) RET

** You can also use cua-mode.

Select the rectangle région (all the nn) and then M-x cua-rectangle-mark-mode.

Next, M-n and accept the default values.

ysiw]: ({  [Hello]  } world!)     // no space
ysiw<em>: ({ <em>Hello</em> } world!)
dst: ({ Hello } world!) // t: tag

* package management
(use-package auto-package-update
   :ensure t
   :config
   (setq auto-package-update-delete-old-versions t
         auto-package-update-interval 4)
   (auto-package-update-maybe))
With that setup, packages will be updated every 4 days, and the old packages will be removed.

* search in project
+ivy-project-search uses ripgrep. Ripgrep does not obey .projectile files, and I have no intention of implementing that, nor connecting it to projectile-rg because a) it's tremendously slow, b) projectile will be replaced with project.el in the future, and
c) it is redundant with what ripgrep already supports through .ignore and .gitignore files, which all of Doom's file/search commands respect.
Alternatively, you can adjust counsel-rg-base-command with exemption flags to apply to all searches.

To only search lua files: #test -- -t lua. Run $ rg --type-list for comprehensive list of types that Ripgrep supports.

To search any file that matches a glob: #test -- -g*.tar.gz

To search for test, but filter out results with cd in it, use consult’s sub-search feature: #test#!cd.

Everything before the second # is filtered by ripgrep.

Everything after the second # is filtered by Vertico using Orderless 4, where ! (negatation), = (literal), ~ (fuzzy), % (case insensitive) prefixes are supported.

The # delimiter can be replaced with any arbitrary character. E.g. %test%!cd or *test*!cd.

#word -- -s: search for 'word' case sensitive

* tty pty
A tty is a terminal (it stands for teletype - the original terminals used a line
printer for output and a keyboard for input!). A terminal is a basically just a
user interface device that uses text for input and output.

A pty is a pseudo-terminal - it's a software implementation that appears to the
attached program like a terminal, but instead of communicating directly with a
"real" terminal, it transfers the input and output to another program.

For example, when you ssh in to a machine and run ls, the ls command is sending
its output to a pseudo-terminal, the other side of which is attached to the SSH
daemon.

% ：表示整个文件，同“1,$”；

s : 表示替换
[option] : 表示操作类型

c 表示进行确认
p 表示替代结果逐行显示（Ctrl + L恢复屏幕）
省略option时仅对每行第一个匹配串进行替换
