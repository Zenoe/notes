people dont do things TO us, they do things FOR themselves
don't take things personally
1. it's not about us, look into their intentions.
Look at WE. What's their intention. understand where they are coming from . For example, they want to be right, maybe they have a call they have been waiting for.

2. if it's about us, give yourself empathy. openly speak up, show vulnerbility
only when someone hit your raw nerve, you are broken.
deal with your negative beliefs. We take things personally because we know there is some truth in it. Big chance this is rooted in your childhood. So give yourself some empathy.

"People may attack you, criticise you, or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out, or even walk all over you. But remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value"
