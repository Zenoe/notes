The default generator for Windows seems to be set to NMAKE. Try to use:

cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
Or use the GUI, and select MinGW Makefiles when prompted for a generator. Don't forget to cleanup the directory where you tried to run CMake, or delete the cache in the GUI. Otherwise, it will try again with NMAKE.
